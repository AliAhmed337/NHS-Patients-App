Our project uses the react native framework to build an application using react and Javascript.
We also use expo, a toolchain build around react native.
we have also incorporated third party libraries such as redux and redux-thunck for state management within the app.

expo: https://expo.io/
react native: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/

Methods of demoing:
Viewing the current version in Testflight:
Testflight houses our live build, that will be deployed to for as long as the client would like to support it.
Since we intend to continue maintaining the project, this is a good way of looking at the most up-to-date build.
This build is subject to change and can be found at: HTTPS://testflight.apple.com/join/k2X3YS3T

Installing our project locally:
Make sure you have node.js for npm commands
- install expo cli through the command npm install expo-cli --global
- travel to the directory in terminal your favourite IDE and run npm install for all dependancies
- finally, run expo start and this should spin up a development server. 
- You have the option to download the expo app on your phone to scan the QR code to witness the demo live in device
- You can also run it in a simulator, given that you have installed the neccesary programs.

Inside the App:

When the application launches you will be presented with 2 types of authentication:

- scanning a QR code
- manual authentication: manually typing a code

a qr code will be given as pdf in the submission folder in order to successfully use qr authentication
For manual authentication the code OTI will give you access

in practice patents will be sent a letter containing a qr code & manual code generated by our backend web application when assigned an appointment

since we had a license already the client has a build in testflight of the application that is updated in real time to see constant changes and improvements within the app

notable libraries used:

- react-navigation (navigation through the app)
- react-redux      (state management)
- react-thunk      (state management)
- jest             (testing)
- expo             (toolchain)
