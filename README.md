# Team DANF (Team Dolphins are not forever)
**Project: Medical Appointments**

This repository is for the cross-platform mobile application component of the project.
The web application component can be found at [domswainkcl/med-app-nhs-web-app](https://github.com/domswainekcl/med-app-nhs-web-app).

Our project uses the **React Native** library to build an application using **React** and **Javascript**, and has been developed using the **Expo** toolchain.

We have also incorporated third-party libraries which are listed at the bottom of this file.

## Methods of demoing:

Google Play and Testflight contain our live build, that will be deployed to for as long as the client would like to support it. Since we intend to continue maintaining the project, this is a good way of looking at the most up-to-date build.

### Viewing the current version of the app:

**iOS:** https://testflight.apple.com/join/k2X3YS3T

**Android:** https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.dominicswaine.nhsappointments

## Installing our project locally:

Make sure you have node.js for npm commands.
* Install expo cli through the command `npm install expo-cli --global`
* Switch to the directory in terminal your favourite IDE and run `npm install` for all dependencies
* Finally, run `expo start` and this will start a local development server.
* You have the option to download the Expo app on your phone, from which you can scan the QR code and view the the app live.
* If you have installed the necessary programs, you can also view the app in a simulator.

## Inside the App:

When the application launches you will be presented with 2 types of authentication:

* Scanning a QR code
* Manual authentication (typing in a code)

A QR code will be given as `.pdf` in the submission folder in order to successfully use QR authentication.
For manual authentication, the code `NJETYOTI` will give you access.

In practice, patients will be sent a letter containing a QR code & manual code generated by our back-end web application when assigned an appointment.
