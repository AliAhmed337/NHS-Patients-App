Our project uses the react native framework to build an application using react and Javascript.
We also use expo, a toolchain build around react native.
we have also incorporated third party libraries such as redux and redux-thunck for state management within the app.

expo: https://expo.io/
react native: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/

Authentication:

When the application launches you will be presented with 2 types of authentication:

- scanning a QR code
- manual authentication: manually typing a code

a qr code will be given as pdf in the submission folder in order to successfully use qr authentication
For manual authentication the code OTI will give you access

in practice patents will be sent a letter containing a qr code & manual code generated by our backend web application when assigned an appointment

since we had a license already the client has a build in testflight of the application that is updated in real time to see constant changes and improvements within the app

notable libraries used:

- react-navigation (navigation through the app)
- react-redux      (state management)
- react-thunk      (state management)
- jest             (testing)
- expo             (toolchain)
